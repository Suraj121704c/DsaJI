// Impress them ladies Ended
// Description

// Sachin loves running. He often visits his favourite Jogging Park and runs for very long distances.

// On one such visit he found that the number of girls in the park was unusually high. Now he wants to use this as an opportunity to impress a large number of girls with his awesome speed.

// The track on which he runs is an N kilometres long straight path. There are a[i] girls standing within the ith kilometre of this path. A girl will be impressed only if Sachin is running at his maximum speed when he passes by her.

// But he can run at his best speed only for a single continuous stretch of K kilometres. Now Sachin wants to know what is the maximum number of girls that he can impress


// Input
// Input Format
// First line contains one integer t — the number of test cases.

// The next 2*t lines contain the description of the t testcases.

// The first line of each testcase contains two integers - n and k.

// The second line contains n space separated integers - a[1],a[2]....a[n].

// Constraints
// 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3

// 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 10^5

// 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^6


// Output
// Output Format
// For each test case print one line containing an integer, denoting the maximum number of girls Sachin can impress.


// Sample Input 1 

// 1
// 7 2
// 2 4 8 1 2 1 8
// Sample Output 1

// 12
// Hint

// He can impress 4+8=12 girls if he runs at his best speed between the 2nd and the 3rd kilometre, inclusive.
